#Planning Interfaces
This repo has many different planning interfaces for [Agile Research Studios](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/projects/dtr). Interfaces particularly focus on generating and evaluating alternative slices. Each folder has a different interfaces, please open the index.html to view them.

###DTR Bars (/dtr-bars)
Users enter the work they have done previously and the work that they plan to do within the sprint in the areas of Design, Technology, and Research. 
The purpose of this interface is to bring student’s attention to the balance in their research efforts across the areas of Design, Technology, and Research. Uses High charts and Bootstrap.

###Radar Chart (/spiderweb)
Users have the ability to see work on their claims at a high level using a radar chart. Users input work towards a claim across three options to compare and contrast three different high level plans. Uses Angular JS and D3.

###Fidelities (/fidelity)
Users generate three different fidelities - low, medium, and high - for stories. Then they evaluate them on a chart of value-delivering vs. realistic to understand what fidelity to do. Uses Highcharts and Bootstrap.


###Playground (/playground)
Users create alternative plans to completing a story, but with tasks to allow them to think in concrete slices at the story level. The left side of the interface is a “task bank” for users to write in their tasks. The four other columns are space for alternative plans for users. Users can then fill in alternative plans to stories and consider options between them visually. Uses Boostrap and Draggable JS.


#Best Practice Sidebar Mockup
This mockup allows us to test the suggestion of best practices to researchers while sprint planning.

###Installation
You can run a local version of this project by cloning the repository (using `git clone git@github.com:NUDelta/sprint-planning.git` or by clicking the "Download Zip" button) and then opening the index.html file in your browser. 

###Technology
Currently, this mockup uses AngularJS to do some basic binding between form inputs and Gold Standard Stories, and Bootstrap for styling.
